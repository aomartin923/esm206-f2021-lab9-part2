```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(broom)
```

## Read in data

```{r}
lizards <- read_csv(here("data", "lizards.csv"))
```

Get counts of lizards by species:

```{r}
lizards %>% 
  count(spp) %>% #how many times the species appears in the data set
  arrange(-n) #arrange in decreasing order
```

##Make a subset that contains:

-UTST lizards
-Sites: IBPE (enclosure grassland), RABB (rabbit mesquite site), "EAST" (east tarbush site)
-tail condition is recorded (W= whole, B = broken)

```{r}
utst <- lizards %>% 
  filter (spp =="UTST") %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("IBPE", "RABB", "EAST")) %>% 
  filter(tail %in% c('B','W'))

```
